# Machine Learning from Scratch in R

**ML algorithms implemented from scratch using R**

This repository contains machine learning algorithm implementations built from the ground up in R, focusing on understanding the mathematical foundations and core concepts behind each algorithm.

## Project Goals

- **Learn by Building**: Understand ML algorithms by implementing them from scratch
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Focus on the math and logic behind each algorithm
- **Clean R Code**: Well-documented, readable R implementations
- **Educational Resource**: Serve as a learning tool for ML enthusiasts

## Algorithms Implemented

### Completed
- [ ] **Linear Regression** (Simple & Multiple) 
- [ ] **Logistic Regression**
- [ ] **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- [ ] **Naive Bayes**

### Planned Implementations
- [ ] **Decision Tree**
- [ ] **Random Forest**
- [ ] **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- [ ] **K-Means Clustering**
